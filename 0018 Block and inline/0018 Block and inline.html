    <!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. -->

    <!-- A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). -->

            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
            
            This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. -->

    <!-- The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

    The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

    When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
-->
<br>
    <h1>This is a div</h1>
    <div style="background-color: black; color:white; padding:20px; " >
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>    
    </div>



    <!-- The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

        The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        
        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: -->

            <h1>this is a span</h1>
    <p>I hav <span style="color: brown;" >brown</span> eyes but I want to change it in <span style="color: green;" >green</span>.</p>
